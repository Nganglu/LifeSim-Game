    *EVENT SYSTEM
        -Establishing event format and queueing
        -EventType definitions
        -Syncing SimulationManager and World
    
    -Daily growth algorithm for age and biological sex


BODY
    -Change units -> age (from year to day), weight (from kg to g), height (from m to cm)
    -implementing health & energy
        -Refining body with body parts
            -derivating part size (height and weight) from body
            -implementing health for bodyPart
